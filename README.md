gem "the_role", "~> 2.0.0"
```

```ruby
bundle
```

install note

```
bundle exec rails g the_role --help
```
### Change User model

add one line in user model is depend upon the association
if user has one role then add
```ruby
include TheRole::User::HasOneRole
```
and if user has many roles then add
```ruby
include TheRole::User::HasManyRoles
```

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
 # has_one role
 include TheRole::User::HasManyRoles
 # or following alias for AR:
 # has_many roles
 # include TheRole::User::HasManyRoles

  # has_many :pages
end
```

### Create Role model

Generate Role model

```ruby
bundle exec rails g the_role install
```

or you can create Role model manually:

```ruby
class Role < ActiveRecord::Base
  include TheRole::Role
  # or following alias for AR:
  # acts_as_role
end
```
install TheRole migrations

```ruby
rake the_role_engine:install:migrations
```

Invoke migration

```ruby
rake db:migrate
```
### Create role dynamic
install dynamic declaration of roles
its more helpfull in many to many association
```ruby
 bundle exec rails g the_role many-to-many
```
or create manually
* this is help to create roles group like read, write, other

```ruby
# config/permissions.yml
users:
  read:
    index: true
    show: true
  write:
    new: true
    create: true
    edit: true
    update: true
    destory: true
  print:
    print: true

roles:
  read:
    index: true
    show: true
  write:
    new: true
    create: true
    edit: true
    update: true
    destory: true

messages:
  read:
    index: true
    show: true
  write:
    new: true
    create: true
    edit: true
    update: true
    destory: true
  print:
    print: true
```

```ruby
# config/initializers/permission.rb

class Permission
  class << self
    def get_permissions
      @@permissions ||= YAML.load_file('config/permissions.yml')
    end
    def permission(controller, action)
      get_permissions[controller.to_s][action.to_s] rescue nil
    end
  end
end
```
* this method read the permissiion from yml file and initialized al load time

add one class method in the Role class, which create a appropriate rules according to the group

file:- app/models/role

```ruby

    # This method create one permoission json oject for the role
    # input json format is 
    #   {"users"=>{"read"=>"1", "write"=>"1", "other"=>"1"}, "roles"=>{"read"=>"0", "write"=>"0"}}
    # then outupt will be 
    #  "{\"users\":{\"index\":true,\"show\":true,\"new\":true,\"create\":true,\"edit\":true,\"update\":true,\"destory\":true,\"print\":true}}"
    # parameter => role object
    # method => class method
    def self.set_the_role json
        hash = {}
        json.each do |key, value|
          value.each do |k, v|
            # binding.pry
            hash.deep_merge!(key => Permission.permission(key, k)) if v == '1'
          end
        end
        hash.to_json
      end
```

If your are using the rails 4 then calculate the the role has before the params permit action
```ruby
# app/controllers/roles_controllers.rb
    def roles_params
        params[:role][:the_role] = Role.set_the_role params[:role][:the_role]
        params.require(:role).permit!#(:name, :title, :description, :the_role)
    end

```

### Create Admin

Create admin role

```
bundle exec rails g the_role admin
```

Makes any user as Admin

```
User.first.update( role: Role.with_name(:admin) )
```

## Integration

#### Change your ApplicationController

**include TheRoleController** in your Application controller

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include TheRole::Controller

  protect_from_forgery

  def access_denied
    flash[:error] = t('the_role.access_denied')
    redirect_to(:back)
  end
end
```
### Configuration

create the_role config:

```
bundle exec rails g the_role config
```

**config/initializers/the_role.rb**

```ruby
TheRole.configure do |config|
  config.layout                = :application
  config.default_user_role     = :user
  config.access_denied_method  = :access_denied      # define it in ApplicationController
  config.login_required_method = :authenticate_user! # devise auth method

  # config.first_user_should_be_admin = false
  # config.destroy_strategy           = :restrict_with_exception # can be nil
end
```

#### Using with any controller

```ruby
class PagesController < ApplicationController
  before_action :login_required, except: [:index, :show]
  before_action :role_required,  except: [:index, :show]

  before_action :set_page,       only: [:edit, :update, :destroy]
  before_action :owner_required, only: [:edit, :update, :destroy]

  def edit
     # ONLY OWNER CAN EDIT THIS PAGE
  end

  private

  def set_page
    @page = Page.find params[:id]

    # TheRole: You should define OWNER CHECK OBJECT
    # When editable object was found
    # You should define @owner_check_object before invoking **owner_required** method
    @owner_check_object = @page
  end
end
```

### Assets and Bootstrap

**application.css**

```
//= require bootstrap
```

**application.js**

```
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs

//= require bootstrap
//= require the_role_editinplace
```

## Understanding

#### TheRole instead of CanCan?

TheRole in contrast to CanCan has simple and predefined way to find access state of current role. If you don't want to create your own role scheme with CanCan Abilities - TheRole can be a great solution for your.

You can manage roles with simple UI. TheRole's ACL structure is inspired by Rails controllers, that is why it's so great for Rails application.

#### What does it mean semantic?

Semantic - the science of meaning. Human should be able to understand fast what is happening in a role system.

Look at the next Role hash. If you can understand access rules - this authorization system is semantic.

```ruby
role = {
  'pages' => {
    'index'   => true,
    'show'    => true,
    'new'     => false,
    'edit'    => false,
    'update'  => false,
    'destroy' => false
  },
  'articles' => {
    'index'  => true,
    'show'   => true
  },
  'twitter'  => {
    'button' => true,
    'follow' => false
  }
}
```

#### Virtual sections and rules

Usually, we use real names of controllers and actions for names of sections and rules:

```ruby
@user.has_role?(:pages, :show)
```

But, also, you can use virtual names of sections, and virtual names of section's rules.

```ruby
@user.has_role?(:twitter, :button)
@user.has_role?(:facebook, :like)
```

And you can use them as well as other access rules.

#### Using with Views

```ruby
<% if @user.has_role?(:twitter, :button) %>
  Twitter Button is Here
<% else %>
  Nothing here :(
<% end %>
```

#### Who is Administrator?

Administrator is the user who can access any section and the rules of your application.

Administrator is the owner of any objects in your application.

Administrator is the user, which has virtual section **system** and rule **administrator** in the role-hash.


```ruby
admin_role_fragment = {
  :system => {
    :administrator => true
  }
}
```

#### Who is Moderator?

Moderator is the user, which has access to any actions of some section(s).

Moderator is the owner of any objects of some class.

Moderator is the user, which has a virtual section **moderator**, with **section name** as rule name.

There is Moderator of Pages (controller) and Twitter (virtual section)

```ruby
moderator_role_fragment = {
  :moderator => {
    :pages   => true,
    :blogs   => false,
    :twitter => true
  }
}
```

#### Who is Owner?

Administrator is owner of any object in system.

Moderator of pages is owner of any page.

User is owner of object, when **Object#user_id == User#id**.


# API

## User

```ruby
# User's role
@user.role # => Role obj
```

Is it Administrator?

```ruby
@user.admin?                       => true | false
```

Is it Moderator?

```ruby
@user.moderator?(:pages)           => true | false
@user.moderator?(:blogs)           => true | false
@user.moderator?(:articles)        => true | false
```

Has user got an access to **rule** of **section** (action of controller)?

```ruby
@user.has_role?(:pages,    :show)  => true | false
@user.has_role?(:blogs,    :new)   => true | false
@user.has_role?(:articles, :edit)  => true | false

# return true if one of roles is true
@user.any_role?(pages: :show, posts: :show) => true | false
```

Is user **Owner** of object?

```ruby
@user.owner?(@page)                => true | false
@user.owner?(@blog)                => true | false
@user.owner?(@article)             => true | false
```

## Role

```ruby
# Find a Role by name
@role = Role.with_name(:user)
```

```ruby
@role.has?(:pages, :show)       => true | false
@role.moderator?(:pages)        => true | false
@role.admin?                    => true | false

# return true if one of roles is true
@role.any?(pages: :show, posts: :show) => true | false
```

#### CREATE

```ruby
# Create a section of rules
@role.create_section(:pages)
```

```ruby
# Create rule in section (false value by default)
@role.create_rule(:pages, :index)
```

#### READ

```ruby
@role.to_hash => Hash

# JSON string
@role.to_json => String

# check method
@role.has_section?(:pages) => true | false
```

#### UPDATE

```ruby
# set this rule on
@role.rule_on(:pages, :index)
```

```ruby
# set this rule off
@role.rule_off(:pages, :index)
```

```ruby
# Incoming hash is true-mask-hash
# All the rules of the Role will be reseted to false
# Only rules from true-mask-hash will be set true
new_role_hash = {
  :pages => {
    :index => true,
    :show => true
  }
}

@role.update_role(new_role_hash)
```

#### DELETE

```ruby
# delete a section
@role.delete_section(:pages)

# delete a rule in section
@role.delete_rule(:pages, :show)
```
